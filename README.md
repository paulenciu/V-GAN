# Introduction 
Repository for the V-GAN algorithm in paper "Adversarial Subspace Generation for Knowledge Discovery in High Dimensional Data" for subspace search.

Our proposed algorithm, V-GAN, is capable of identifying a collection of subspaces relevant to a studied population $\mathbf{X}$. We do so by building on a theoretical framework that explains the _Multiple Views_ phenomenom of data. 
Details of this will be added in the future, alongside a pre-print version of the paper.


# Installation

To install, simply use the requirements.txt file 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Additionally, if you plan to train VGAN, you should also install the torch-two-sample package: 

```
git clone git@github.com:josipd/torch-two-sample.git
cd torch-two-sample
pip install .
```
When using uv, after installing torch-two-sample, to avoid uv deleting it use the command:
```
uv sync --inexact
```
